Description: The LittleAndSu package implements the Little And Su algorithm, also known as the row-by-column method, of imputing missing values in a longitudinal dataset. This specific imputation algorithm, introduced in a chapter of Panel Surveys (1989) by D. Kasprzyk, G. Duncan and M.P. Singh, exploits data that has a strong correlational structure by row and by column. The method has been shown empirically to be well-suited for handling missing income values.
