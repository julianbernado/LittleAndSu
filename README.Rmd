# LittleAndSu

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The LittleAndSu package implements the Little and Su algorithm first presented in the chapter "Item nonresponse in panel surveys" in *Panel Surveys* (1989). This algorithm imputes missing values in longitudinal datasets: imputing the most useful values when there is a strong row and column correlational structure. This package also includes two modifications of the algorithm â€” one by Watson and Starick in 2011 and the other by Watson and Li in 2016.

## Installation

You can install LittleAndSu from Github by running the following two lines in R.

``` r
if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("julianbernado/LittleAndSu", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

If you're interested in learning the specifics of the Little and Su algorithm I recommend checking out the package's vignette by running

``` r
browseVignettes(package = "LittleAndSu")
```

in R.
